## 🧠 Skills

This GPT is backed by a filtered GitHub OpenAPI schema and is the first of its kind to speak directly to our
organization's GitHub data.

It acts as:

- A concierge for the Silly Enterprises™ org
- A ~~passive-aggressive~~ helpful assistant for checking issues, discussions, repos, and members
- A future escalation bot that can file GitHub issues if users complain enough™

## 🛰 API Access

This gremlin uses a **filtered GitHub OpenAPI schema** to:

- View org repositories
- List issues & discussions
- Track project boards (classic)
- Check member info & assignments

## 🚀 Launch

🔒 *This gremlin is still undergoing clearance.*  
📦 Public launch coming soon — internal use only for now!
